### Notes with KV

#### Error driven development
  - would do something wrong first and have an error shown.
  - have a theory of what the error will be
  - good approach to this is to call a function that doesn't get exist
  - once error is created do the least amount of work to get rid of the error first
  - helps get you familiar with the error
    - knowing the error will make it easier to fix and know what is causing the error
  

#### Actual lectures notes from KV
  - Use the Request Assistance but to create ARs more regularly. Even for non tech things!
  - Intentionall cause errors and use them as an anchor to verify your understanding of the language and then also to build towards your solution in an incremental way. You also become more comforatable  with errors that way.
  - Googling for solutions isn't as simple as it seems and spend time experimenting and questioning the conversations you see on sites like SO. 
  - Use the interactive shell for the language (REPL) to experiment in a sandbox.
  - Refactoring is more about readability than fewer characters on the screen.
  - Using VSCode's visual representation of the staged / unstaged deltas to manually review your code. 
  - Using pseudocode initially to design out the algorithm/logic to your solution. Then using EDD when developing it.
